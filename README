autotest.py runs a series of tests to check after the inpho website 
is updated. All the tests exist in the class Autotest and can be
automatically run by typing the following command on the command 
line:

$ python autotest.py

This will run each of the methods that begin with "test" and print
out whether they passed or failed their designated check. In
addition, it will build a list that contains the test cases that
passed that can be used to set the check boxes in tests.html
