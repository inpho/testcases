autotest.py runs a series of tests to check after the inpho website 
is updated. All the tests exist in the class Autotest and can be
automatically run by typing the following command on the command 
line:

$ python autotest.py

This will run each of the methods that begin with "test" and print
out whether they passed or failed their designated check.

More information about the unittest2 library can be found at
http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html.


results.py is a testing file that runs each test in Autotest
individually and prints out PASSED/FAILED and each test's doc string.
like the autotest.py file, result.py can be run on the command line
the same way with:

$ python results.py

This file shows how access all the information necessary for the 
tests to be used to automatically set the checkboxes in tests.py
